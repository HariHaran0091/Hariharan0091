Cloud Engineer with 3+ years of experience working extensively with AWS, Linux, Git, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, GitLab CI, and DevSecOps practices. I specialize in designing, deploying, and managing scalable, secure cloud infrastructures and automated delivery pipelines.

I have strong expertise in Docker, building and managing containerized environments to support modern application workflows. Alongside this, I bring practical monitoring experience using ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana for log management and performance visibility, as well as exposure to PagerDuty for incident alerting and on-call workflows.

With a solid foundation in cloud technologies and automation, I focus on creating efficient workflows that improve software delivery speed and reliability. I’m comfortable collaborating in dynamic, fast-paced environments, using tools like JIRA to ensure smooth project execution.

Driven by curiosity and passion for cloud computing and security, I continuously upskill to stay ahead of evolving technologies and best practices in DevOps and DevSecOps.

I’m seeking opportunities in Cloud Engineering, DevOps, or DevSecOps roles where I can apply my technical skills to contribute to innovative projects and help teams achieve operational excellence.
